3. Click "Code"
4. Copy the SSH url provided by GitHub
5. In the terminal, navigate to the new project repository
6. Type "git clone" and paste the URL
7. Open the repo in your text editor
8. In your terminal, run "npm install", "npm start", then go to "http://localhost:8080/" in your browser
9. You will also need to clone down the API server. Go to [the API repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) and follow install instructions
10. You can now manipulate the application in the browser window

### Learning Goals:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

### Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- GitHub
- GitHub Projects
- Webpack
- APIs
- Day.js

### Wins + Challenges:

#### Wins
- I am so proud of what I have accomplished in the alloted time frame for this project. I got through all four sections of the project
- did well keeping to my wire frame's time frame for myself, although it never seems like enought time
- Extremely proud of my html/css layout. Visually my site looks very nice
- I utilized help from our mentors and peers when we were unable to come up with a solution
#### Challenges 
- Sad path testing is not my friend, will work on improvement of next project 
- When I changed my user to be linked to my user name, I threw of a ton of code and had to refactor a lot of functions. I then realized I should have made my accessability branch before starting all that work, because I did have to do it again.
